## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload an image of size **32x32** in JPG or PNG format
- Real-time classification into one of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes:
  - `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`
- Uses a pre-trained model saved as `TransferlearningSP.keras`
- Deployed via Streamlit
